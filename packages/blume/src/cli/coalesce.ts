/**
 * Wrap an async task so it never runs concurrently with itself. Triggering the
 * returned function while a run is in flight coalesces into a single trailing
 * run after the current one settles.
 *
 * Dev regeneration (`scanProject` + `generateRuntime`) is expensive on a large
 * project — a full content re-scan that allocates big strings. A plain debounce
 * still lets a fast burst of watch events (or, before it was fixed, a `.blume/`
 * watch storm) start a new scan before the previous finished, piling up
 * overlapping scans until the heap is exhausted (observed as an OOM after
 * minutes of looping). Single-flighting bounds it to one scan at a time while
 * still guaranteeing a final run reflects the latest change.
 *
 * The task must not reject: a rejection would surface as an unhandled promise
 * rejection, so callers handle their own errors and always resolve.
